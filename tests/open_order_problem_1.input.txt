# The tws_decode_msg_util dump tool attempts to be 'smart': it can handle input formats where
# new lines starting with a # are considered 'comment'; it can cope with the RAW TWS message format
# which is field-based, NUL-terminated per field, and 'human readable' dump formats like the one below
# (which is ripped from a message posted on the TWSAPI yahoo mailing list).
#
# Run as:
#    tws_decode_msg_util -i tests/open_order_problem_1.input.txt
#
# --- yahoo TWSAPI message: ---
#
# I am looking for docs abt how to decode the message received from IB.
# For example, when i enter a trade and check open orders using reqOpenOrders method, the message content i got back:
#
# The trade is to buy USD/JPY with amt of 25000 at 70, limit order, GTC.
# However, i dont see any 70 value here.
#
# The [3] should be order id, [12] symbol, [24] account number 
#
